        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a full-stack developer that enjoys learning new things and meeting new people. I also love watching sports
            (every sport, even snooker and darts) and I love talking and discussing it with people. I also enjoy
            contributing to other people projects and working on my own ideas.</p>
